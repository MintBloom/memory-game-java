# Software Programming Project 1 - Memory Game/Snap
MemoryGameJava.java is the file for this project and should come with a README
## Instructions for Play
1. You will be asked for a row and column selection which will be asked on separate lines e.g. "first row number: " and on the line below "first column number:  ". If your response to each of these is an integer from 0-3, that is not already revealed, the corresponding spot on the board will then be revealed. This step will repeat for your second chosen spot on the board.
2. If both of these spots on the board are a match they will stay face up, and if not, they will both be flipped over, hidden and you will be asked to choose another spot on the board. This process will repeat until all matches on the board have been found.
